The AVM FRITZ!Box Tools integration allows you to control your [AVM FRITZ!Box](https://avm.de/produkte/fritzbox/) based router.

There is support for the following platform types within Home Assistant:

- **Device tracker** - presence detection by looking at connected devices.
- **Binary sensor** - connectivity status.
- **Sensor** - external IP address and uptime.

TR-064 needs to be enabled in the FRITZ!Box network settings for Home Assistant to login and read device info.

## Username

The configuration in the UI asks for a username. Starting from FRITZ!OS 7.24 the FRITZ!Box creates a random username for the admin user if you didn't set one yourself. This can be found after logging into the FRITZ!Box and visiting System -> FRITZ!Box Users -> Users. The username starts with `fritz` followed by four random numbers. Under properties on the right it says `created automatically`. Prior to FRITZ!OS 7.24 the default username was `admin`.

## Services

Currently supported services are Platform specific:

- `fritz.reconnect`
- `fritz.reboot`

### Platform Services

## Integration Options

It is possible to change some behaviors through the integration options.
These can be changed at **AVM FRITZ!Box Tools** -> **Configure** on the Integrations page.

- **Consider home**: Number of seconds that must elapse before considering a disconnected device "not at home".

## Additional info

**Note 1**: All devices to be tracked, even the new detected, are disabled by default. You need to enable the wanted entities manually.

**Note 2**: If you don't want to automatically track newly detected devices, disable the integration system option `Enable new added entities`.
