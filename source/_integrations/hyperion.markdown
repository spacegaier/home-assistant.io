The `hyperion` platform allows you to integrate your
[Hyperion](https://docs.hyperion-project.org/) into Home Assistant. Hyperion is
an open source Ambilight implementation which runs on many platforms.

**NOTE**: [Hyperion-NG](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) is
supported, the original [discontinued Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion) is not supported by
this integration.

## Configuration

This integration can be configured using the integrations in the
Home Assistant frontend.

Menu: **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

In most cases, Hyperion servers will be automatically discovered by
Home Assistant. Those automatically discovered devices are listed
on the integrations page.

If for some reason Hyperion isn't discovered, it can be added manually.

Click on the `+` sign to add an integration and click on **Hyperion**.
After completing the configuration flow, the Hyperion integration will be
available.

### Extra configuration of the integration

All configuration options are offered from the frontend. Choose `Options` under the
relevant entry on the `Integrations` page.

Options supported:
- **priority**: The priority for color and effects, make sure this is lower then the streaming sources priority in hyperion itself (typically lower than 200 is appropriate).

## Hyperion Instances

This integration supports multiple Hyperion instances running on a single Hyperion
server. As instances are added/removed on the Hyperion UI, they will automatically be
added/removed from Home Assistant.

## Effects

The effect list is dynamically pulled from the Hyperion server. The following
extra effects will be available:

- BOBLIGHTSERVER: Use a Boblight-Server configured in Hyperion.
- GRABBER: Use a 'Platform Capture' grabber that is configured in Hyperion.
- V4L: Use a 'USB Capture' V4L device that is configured in Hyperion.
- Solid: Use a solid color only.

## Examples

To start Hyperion with an effect, use the following automation:

```yaml
automation:
- id: one
  alias: Turn Hyperion effect on when light goes on
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: light.hyperion
      to: 'on'
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      data:
        entity_id: light.hyperion
        effect: "Full color mood blobs"
```

To have the lights playing an effect when pausing, idle or turn off a media player like Plex you can use this example:

```yaml
- alias: Set hyperion effect after playback
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.plex
      to: 'off'
    - platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.plex.plex
      to: 'paused'
    - platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.plex.plex
      to: 'idle'
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      data:
        entity_id: light.hyperion
        effect: "Full color mood blobs"
```

To capture the screen when playing something on a media_player you can use this example:

```yaml
- alias: Set hyperion when playback starts
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.plex
      to: 'playing'
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      data:
        entity_id: light.hyperion
        effect: V4L
```
