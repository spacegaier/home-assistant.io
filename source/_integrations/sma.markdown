The SMA Solar integration will poll a [SMA](http://www.sma-solar.com/) [(US)](https://www.sma-america.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

The integration uses the web interface of the device. Before you start, make sure you are able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

## Sensors

Sensors available in the library:

| name         | Unit | Description   |
|--------------|------|:-------------------------------------------|
| grid_power   | W    | Power supplied to the grid by the inverter.  grid_power = power_l1 + power_l2 + power_l3 |
| power_l1     | W    | Power for phase 1.   |
| power_l2     | W    | Power for phase 2.   |
| power_l3     | W    | Power for phase 3.   |
| frequency    | Hz   | Grid frequency.   |
| voltage_l1   | V    | Voltage for phase 1.   |
| voltage_l2   | V    | Voltage for phase 2.   |
| voltage_l3   | V    | Voltage for phase 3.   |
| current_l1   | A    | Current for phase 1.   |
| current_l2   | A    | Current for phase 2.   |
| current_l3   | A    | Current for phase 3.   |
| pv_power_a   | W    | Current power generated by the solar panels (A side).   |
| pv_power_b   | W    | Current power generated by the solar panels (B side).    |
| pv_voltage_a | V    | Current voltage generated by the solar panels (A side).   |
| pv_voltage_b | V    | Current voltage generated by the solar panels (B side).   |
| pv_current_a | A    | Current amperage generated by the solar panels (A side).   |
| pv_current_b | A    | Current amperage generated by the solar panels (B side).   |
| pv_gen_meter | kWh  | Total kWh generated to date.   |
| total_yield  | kWh  | Total power yield from a solar installation.   |
| daily_yield  | Wh   | The solar plant's yield for today   |
| grid_power_supplied | W    | Power supplied.   |
| grid_power_absorbed | W    | Power absorbed.   |
| grid_total_yield | kWh  | Total power from the grid.   |
| grid_total_absorbed | kWh  | Total power supplied to the grid.   |
| current_consumption | W    | Power that you are currently drawing, depending on your installation it can be a combination of the inverter and the grid.   |
| total_consumption | kWh  | Total power consumption.   |

### Custom Sensors

The SMA WebConnect module supports a wide variety of sensors, but not all of these have been mapped in the `pysma` library. New sensors can be tested by using YAML configuration. The YAML config is deprecated, nevertheless, an example is provided below. You will need a sensor name, the SMA sensor key and the unit. The path attribute is a custom JMESpath to extract the sensor value and typically not required (advanced use only).

Example:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: sma
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
    ssl: true
    verify_ssl: false
    password: YOUR_SMA_PASSWORD
    custom:
      yesterday_consumption:
          key: "6400_00543A01"
          unit: kWh
          factor: 1000
```

Feel free to submit additional sensors to be added as standard sensors to the [pysma library](https://github.com/kellerza/pysma/blob/master/pysma/__init__.py#L100).
