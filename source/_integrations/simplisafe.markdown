The `simplisafe` integration integrates [SimpliSafe home security](https://simplisafe.com) (V2 and V3) systems into Home Assistant. Multiple SimpliSafe accounts can be accommodated.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Alarm Control Panel**: reports on the current alarm status and can be used to arm and disarm the system.
- **CO Detector**: reports on the carbon monoxide sensor status*.
- **Entry Sensor**: reports on the current entry sensor status*.
- **Freeze Sensor**: reports on the freeze sensor temperature*.
- **Glass Break Sensor**: reports on the glass breakage sensor status*.
- **Lock**: reports on `Door Locks` and can be used to lock and unlock a lock.
- **Motion Sensor**: reports on motion detected.
- **Siren**: reports on the siren status*.
- **Smoke Detector**: reports on the smoke sensor status*.
- **Water Sensor**: reports on water sensor status*.

* Sensor status is only available for SimpliSafe V3 systems and is updated once every 30 seconds, so information displayed in Home Assistant may be delayed.

by looking at the device state attributes for the integration's `alarm_control_panel`

## Events

### `SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION`

`SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION` events represent system notifications that would appear in the
messages section of the SimpliSafe web and mobile apps. When received, they come with
event data that contains the following keys:

* `category`: The notification category (e.g., `error`)
* `code`: The SimpliSafe code for the notification
* `message`: The actual text of the notification
* `timestamp`: The UTC timestamp of the notification

Note that when Home Assistant restarts, `SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION` events will fire once
again for any notifications still active in the SimpliSafe web and mobile apps. To
prevent this, either (a) clear them in the web/mobile app or (b) utilize the 
`simplisafe.clear_notifications` service described above.
