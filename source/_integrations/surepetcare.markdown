## Services

### Service `surepetcare.set_lock_state`

This service lets you change the locking state of a flap.

| Service data attribute | Required | Type | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `flap_id` | `True` | integer | Flap ID to change - see below for instructions on finding device IDs
| `lock_state` | `True` | string | New state to change the flap to

`lock_state` should be one of:

- `unlocked` - flap is unlocked, pets are allowed both in and out.
- `locked_in` - flap is 'in only' - pets can come in but not go back out.
- `locked_out` - flap is 'out only' - pets can go out, but not back in.
- `locked_all` - flap is locked both ways.
