## The issue

Home Assistant detected untrusted code. It looks like someone/something tried to inject not signed images or code into your Home Assistant system. But don't worry, we blocked this action and nothing was applied.

## The solution

Please make sure your network is not affected by an intruder and try it again. To reset this status, you need to restart the Supervisor.
